# Handwritten_digit_recognizer
A good kickstarter to begin with the journey in Data Science,This is literally the hello world of Machine Learning. This does not require any hardware power instead, go with Google Colab. 
# Dataset 
MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images in 28x28 pixel of digits from 0 to 9.

# Architecture 
Lenet by Yan Le Cun. This was the first known CNN architecture with 5 layers, Exclusively for handwritten digit recognition. To know more about the architecture, do refer to the paper(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf)
